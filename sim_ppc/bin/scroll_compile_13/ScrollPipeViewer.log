                           3. when dragging the 'time' scrollbar the 'Mouse Time' window in the 'Info Bar' will update with the
                              cycle count of the sliders real-time position to make up for no real-time updates on drag)
                           4. restored original increments to the scrollbars to pre V1.11 defaults
GRISWELL v1.15 03/11/2004  1. made the warning statements more clear when a autoload fails due to a missing file

                           3. remember color settings across zoom levels/modes
                           4. in resource based mode, all transactions exit resource at end of pipe time instead of staying in 
                              last resource for ever
                           5. in resource based mode, in 'show/hide tag types' option pane the checkboxes reflect the current settings
                           6. in resource based mode, added option in 'Reorder Resources'  under 'based on behavior' to automatically hide

                           3. fixed bug where ctrl-plus ect would only act on pipe 0
                           4. fixed bug in resource ultra zoomed out mode where info was not drawn correctly when scrolling
                           5. added a few more levels of zoom when zooming out before hitting ultra zoom out mode, even though the text
                              becomes too small to read it helps bridge the gap between normal and ultra zoomed out mode.
GRISWELL v1.19 03/17/2004  1. removed blank space at far right of files
                           2. removed one level of normal zooming as it overlapped with the ultra zoomed out first level
                           3. increased the number of zoom out levels in ultra zoom mode, previously it would stop when each pixel
                              represented a single cycle, now it will zoom all the way out to 10 cycles per pixel.  In this mode all events
                              that occur with that 10 cycle window are represented by the color of the last event in the cycle, this works 
                              quite well and allows one to see 10,000 - 15,000 cycles at once depending on your screen resolution.
GRISWELL v1.20 03/24/2004  1. when switching sliders the slider time will now automatically update with that sliders time
                           2. added option on a per tag_type basis in scroll mode to be able to control if events are copied to its children
                              and or parents when it is not visible, previously was for whole file only.  use move_child,[false|true] and
                              move_parent,[false|true] in the config for that tag type entry
                           3. added the abilty to convert .pipes into ascii files.  Here is the new help screen which should explain all:

                           ScrollPipeViewer Version 1.2

                           This program can operate either as a scrollpipe viewer with a GUI or as a conversion

                                                  begin of the pipe, default 0 must be >= 10.
                            -cycle_repeat value - If > 0 will cause the cycle info to be repeated in at interval not
                                                  exceeding this value, default 0.
                           
                            -print_key    value - Value can be true/false, when true a key will be written, default true.
                            -skinny             - Will remove extra spacing in side bar columns to reduce file width at
                                                  the expense of readability.
                           
                            -multi_events value - Controls how multiple events in the same cycle are handled, options are:
                                                   last  - The last event in a cycle will be printed, default.
                                                   first - The first event in a cycle will be printed.
                                                   all   - All events in a cycle will be printed by using multiple lines.
                                                   *Note: when using first or last a '+' and not a '|' will be printed at the
                                                   end of each line where there were multiple events in the same cycle.
                           
                           |---- Resource Mode ----|
                            -show_all           - Will show all resources for each block of time instead of the default
                                                  mode where only resources with activity in a given block of time are shown.
                            -hide_empty         - Will hide resources who are never used in the whole file from being printed,
                                                  use when using the -show_all_resources flag to hide unvisited resources.

GRISWELL v1.21 04/02/2004  1. fixed bug in ultra zoomed out resource mode
GRISWELL v1.22 05/06/2004  1. added null pointer cheking of undefined event types for milestones
                           2. fixed the decoding of the VXOR op
GRISWELL v1.23 05/11/2004  1. fixed associate bug
GRISWELL v1.24 05/24/2004  1. added code to check bounds on resource name to ensure with in bounds
                           2. increaded side bars width form 40 to 60
GRISWELL v1.25 05/28/2004  1. fixed mnemonic decoder problems and added new entries
GRISWELL v1.26 06/08/2004  1. fixed mnemonic decoder of vmaddfp
                           2. added code to ignore events with missing begin
GRISWELL v1.27 09/09/2004  1. fixed bug in scroll mode where the time could be shifted
GRISWELL v1.28 10/05/2004  1. updated mnemonic decoder with new instructions
GRISWELL v1.29 10/12/2004  1. fixed problem when a menu of internal frame overlapped a frame the contents would not update
                           2. renamed the 'Control Panel' to 'Info Bar'.
GRISWELL v1.30 10/14/2004  1. fixed problem with generateing ascii pipes when the unit name was very large
GRISWELL v1.31 11/05/2004  1. fixed issue with ASCII conversion when heads are not destoryed
GRISWELL v1.32 12/13/2004  1. added option to give color (for event_type and tag_type) as a RGB vault (use color=RGB_x_x_x; where x is 0-255)
GRISWELL v1.33 12/14/2004  1. removed all Open Source code (only had one class) and replaced it with built in Java components.  This code
                              managed the 'side bars'.  They will now appear slightly different and behave in a slightly different way when
                              resizing but the overall functionality is the same.
                           2. added one touch close open buttons on new side bar sliders
                           3. new side bar sliders are now sticky and will remember their position when zooming.
GRISWELL v1.34 01/12/2005  1. fixed the decoding of crand.
GRISWELL v1.35 04/13/2005  1. added support for viewing gzipped .pipe files (must end in *.pipe.gz)
                           2. added support for loading  upto 4 files on the command line
                           3. when loading more than 2 files the default window layout will switch from tile horizontally to cascade
GRISWELL v1.36 04/29/2005  1. added option to set the background color of a .pipe file in the .config file using the keyword BACKGROUND in
 		              the .setup section.  It can be one of the defined colors or as a RGB vaule (use BACKGROUND=RGB_x_x_x where x is 0-255).
                              The defined colors are: black, blue, cyan, red, green, magenta, white, yellow, orange
                              example, in the .setup section:  BACKGROUND=white
GRISWELL v1.37 05/16/2005  1. added command line option, -ignoreErrors, that will ignore the 'Missing end bit' Error that is associated with a
                              .pipe not being closed properly.
GRISWELL v1.38 06/06/2005  1. increased the size of the side bar windows underlaying array from 60 to 100 chars.
GRISWELL v1.45 06/07/2005  1. fixed bug with ascii output when using concat
